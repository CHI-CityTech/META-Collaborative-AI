# 🎬 Guiding Document for NotebookLM
### Project: “About Video – Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (LIB 2001ID)”
### Purpose: To generate a self-referential, human–AI co-narrated video introducing the course.

---

## 🧭 1. Overview

This video introduces *Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (LIB 2001ID)* — a general education, interdisciplinary course designed for all majors.  
It aims to show that AI is not only a subject of study but also a **collaborator in learning**.

The video itself should **embody** the principles of the course by blending human and AI voices, demonstrating a *Balanced Blended Space* where ideas flow symmetrically between cognitive (human) and computational (AI) intelligences.

---

## 🧩 2. Core Message

> *We use AI to learn about AI.*

The course explores how humans and artificial intelligences can learn from each other through collaboration, reflection, and critical engagement.  
Students experience AI not as a black box, but as a **partner in cognition**, discovering how their own thinking changes when mediated by intelligent systems.

This video should make that visible — AI helping explain itself, while the human narrator reflects on what that means.

---

## ⚖️ 3. Integration of the Balanced Blended Space (BBS) Framework

The **Balanced Blended Space (BBS)** provides the conceptual backbone for the course and video.

- **BBS Premise:** Intelligence emerges from transactions between agents across **Conceptual, Physical, and Virtual Spaces**.  
- **Mediation Pathways** describe how information moves between **Source**, **Vector**, and **Destination** roles — these can be filled by humans, AIs, or hybrid systems.  
- The **balance** lies in treating human and machine cognition **symmetrically** — neither superior, both necessary.

In the video:
- The **human voice** can act as *Source* (intent and context).  
- The **AI voice** acts as *Vector* (analysis, synthesis, expansion).  
- The **viewer** becomes *Destination*, completing the mediation loop by interpreting and reflecting.

Visual metaphors might include **mirrored networks**, **flowing data between minds**, or **a dialogue across light and code**.

## 🧠 4. The Course: High-Level Description

**Course Title:** Introduction to Artificial Intelligence  
**Code:** LIB 2001ID  
**Credits:** 3  
**Audience:** All majors (no coding required)  
**Modality:** Team-taught, interdisciplinary  

### Key Themes:
- What is intelligence — human or artificial?
- How do machines “learn” and make decisions?
- Where does bias enter into algorithms?
- What happens when AI participates in creative acts?
- How do we use AI responsibly — and cite it ethically?

### Learning Approach:
- **Hands-on:** Use AI chatbots, image generators, and ML tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Teachable Machine).  
- **Reflective:** Students analyze how AI mediates their thought processes.  
- **Collaborative:** Teams of humans and AIs co-develop projects.  
- **Ethical:** Every student learns how to cite and disclose AI participation.

## 🔄 5. Reflexive Learning: “Using AI to Learn AI”

A defining feature of this course is **reflexivity**.  
Students don’t just *study* AI — they *use* it, observe their interactions, and discuss what changes cognitively and socially when an AI becomes part of the classroom dialogue.

This recursive process can be narrated in the video as:

> “When we ask AI about AI, we are already part of the experiment.  
>  The conversation becomes the classroom.”

Possible scenes:
- A student asking an AI to summarize a concept, then reflecting on how the AI’s interpretation differs.  
- AI showing its own summary process visually (NotebookLM parsing text).  
- A “split-screen” moment where human and AI explanations blend into one coherent narrative.

---

## 🌐 6. The Ecology of AI Agents

The course introduces students to multiple AIs, each with a different **functional personality**:

| Agent | Type | Niche in AI Ecosystem |
|--------|------|-----------------------|
| **ChatGPT (GPT-5)** | Conversational reasoning | Discussion partner, idea development |
| **Gemini (Google)** | Integrative synthesis | Multi-modal aggregation and summarization |
| **DeepSeek** | Pattern discovery | Analytical depth and data interpretation |
| **Claude (Anthropic)** | Contextual alignment | Ethical reflection and philosophical reasoning |
| **NotebookLM** | Mediated summarization | Knowledge organization and storytelling |
| **Teachable Machine** | Visual/machine learning | Experiential AI training and demonstration |

This diversity teaches students to view AI as an **ecosystem** — not a monolith — where each agent occupies a niche.  
In the video, these could appear as distinct “voices,” “lights,” or “interfaces” collaborating to build understanding.

---

## 🔗 7. AI Workflow and Collaboration

The course emphasizes **AI workflows**: how multiple agents can collaborate, passing information along mediation pathways.  
For example:
1. A student brainstorms with ChatGPT.  
2. Summaries are refined in NotebookLM.  
3. Gemini cross-references additional sources.  
4. The human integrates, edits, and reflects — closing the cognitive loop.

This workflow metaphor can be visualized as a **signal chain** — each AI a node in a blended circuit of cognition.

## 🪞 8. Tone and Aesthetic Guidance for NotebookLM

The video should feel:
- **Reflective** rather than promotional.  
- **Balanced** between human warmth and machine precision.  
- **Visually hybrid**, blending organic textures (faces, hands, light) with abstract data flows and neural imagery.  
- **Self-aware**, occasionally commenting on its own creation (e.g., “This narration was written by both human and AI voices working together.”)

---

## 🎬 9. Suggested Video Script Outline

**Opening (0:00–0:30)**  
A human narrator asks: “What happens when intelligence is no longer only human?”  
AI voice responds: “We begin to learn together.”

**Middle (0:30–2:00)**  
Alternating narration by human and AI voices.  
- Human introduces the course and goals.  
- AI expands with examples of mediation and reflection.  
- Visuals: student–AI collaboration, data flows, classroom scenes, code morphing into conversation.

**Closing (2:00–3:00)**  
Both voices converge:  
> “This is not just a course about Artificial Intelligence.  
>  It is a conversation — between minds, across systems, within the blended space where learning evolves.”

## 🧾 10. NotebookLM Output Goals

NotebookLM should:
- Provide philosophical and pedagogical rationale fo ra new type of course delivery
- reflect on the use of AI to teach AI.
- Frame it using BBS methodology
- Integrate reflection on collaboration, mediation, and AI ecology.  
- Provide simple visual or voiceover cues for production.

---

## 🧩 11. Integration Cue for BBS Context

If the AI narrator references the course philosophy, it may use phrasing such as:
> “In the Balanced Blended Space, every act of learning is a mediation pathway — a flow of information that transforms both the sender and the receiver.”

---

## 🪄 12. Meta Layer (Optional Voiceover Cue)

If appropriate, include a meta-commentary line:
> “Even this video — the one you’re watching now — was shaped by AI, reflecting the same principles the course explore

## ⏱️ Runtime and Structure Instructions for NotebookLM

Please generate a **6–7 minute video script (~900–1000 words)** alternating between human and AI narration.

Follow this pacing:
1. **Opening (0:00–0:45)** – Reflective question: “What is intelligence?”
2. **Introduction (0:45–1:30)** – Present course and goals.
3. **Core Concepts (1:30–4:30)** – Balanced Blended Space, mediation, AI ecology, reflexive learning.
4. **Practical Dimension (4:30–5:30)** – Collaboration, citation, responsible AI use.
5. **Closing (5:30–6:30)** – Converging narration emphasizing collaboration and transformation.

Maintain a tone that is:
- Reflective, balanced, and conceptually rich.
- Alternating between human warmth and AI precision.
- Visually suggestive of mediation, light, and symmetry.
